# DiscordAutoBot Refactor Status

## Current Phase
Guide Pre-Plan Message Lookup Boundary Preparation

## Overall Progress
Estimated local refactor progress: 65%

## Latest Completed
- Project Architecture V2 established
- Migration framework established
- Architecture guardrails established
- Community read-only migration mostly completed
- Shared publication state contract characterized
- Guide publication baseline completed
- Guide publication plan builder completed
- Guide execution characterization completed
- Guide runtime integration started
- Guide publication persistence writer/repository migrated through application,
  infrastructure, and composition layers
- Execution Request runtime preparation deferred pending an explicit baseline
  decision
- Execution Request reassessed after persistence migration; runtime integration
  rejected and Guide-specific Discord mutation port preparation selected next
- Guide-specific Discord mutation identity, lookup, result, failure, and
  compatibility contracts prepared without a runtime redirect
- Guide-specific Application Port interface, immutable request/result contracts,
  failure vocabulary, and test adapter implemented without wiring
- Guide-specific Infrastructure Adapter boundary characterized with a test-only
  resource harness; no production adapter implemented
- Guide pre-Plan tracked-message lookup timing, force behavior, malformed-ID
  behavior, and Plan mapping characterized; no lookup port, adapter, or runtime
  redirect implemented

## Architecture Health
- Architecture Score: 100 / 100
- Circular Dependencies: 0
- Reverse Layer Dependencies: 0

## Current Ownership
### New Architecture
- Guide publication planning
- Community read-only logic
- Migration orchestration
- Guide/Roadmap publication record persistence
- Guide-specific Discord mutation contract preparation
- Guide-specific Discord mutation Application Port and test adapter
- Guide-specific Discord mutation Infrastructure Adapter preparation
- Guide pre-Plan message lookup preparation documentation and frozen tests

### Legacy
- Discord mutation execution
- Some community mutation flows
- Roles
- Proposals
- Bootstrap
- Permission repair
- Voice / layout high-risk flows

## Deployment Status
- Local refactor: In progress
- GitHub: Current development source
- Vultr production: Pre-refactor legacy version
- Refactored production deployment: Not started

## Deployment Readiness
Not ready for production replacement yet.

Target for first refactored Vultr deployment:
- Guide publication runtime integration complete
- Persistence writer/repository migration complete
- Full test suite green
- Architecture gate green
- Rollback path prepared

## Next Recommended Slice
Implement a Guide Publication Application Lookup Port plus test fake only; do
not add a production adapter, composition wiring, or change legacy execution.

## Required Checks After Every Slice
- Relevant tests PASS
- Migration tests PASS
- Architecture gate PASS
- Legacy audit PASS
- Quality gate PASS

## Blockers
Guide Discord execution remains coupled to message lookup, channel destination,
channel ensure, partial failure, and Roadmap continuation. The pre-Plan lookup
result is now characterized, but no production lookup port or runtime redirect
exists. This continues to block production adapter and runtime redirect work.

## Last Updated
2026-08-08: Guide pre-Plan message lookup boundary characterized; no runtime
migration, lookup port, Discord adapter, or composition wiring.
